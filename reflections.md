 # Hello World

 1. Why is source control, especially Git, important for software development? Explain the problems that source control systems like Git help solve and the benefits they offer.

 Some benefits of source control are: It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase. Developers can commit and merge code without conflicts. Developers can edit shared code without unknowingly overwriting each other's work.



 How do local and remote repositories differ, and why is synchronization between them essential when working with Git? 
 
 Provide a clear understanding of these two aspects of Git.
